There are many tutorials how to connect lcd to arduino. If u still can't connect it, I will show you it in easy steps.

In this tutorial I'm connecting RGB matrix pannel. It works on AdafruitGFXLibrary which u can download here and RGBMatrixPanel with download link below.

1.Just connect pins like u can read on this images. Remeber that u must to INPUT not to OUTPUT. Output is used to connect secend matrix pannel.
2.Some tutorials say something abot power suply(big pins with Vcc and GND in the center) but personally i didn't have to do that. It havent't observed any change with power on or off.
3. When you connect that just run a example program from that libraries. But first u have to change definitions of pins LAT to 11 and CLK 10. This pins defiene settings for matrix panel.
4. After that it should just start running corectly.

Now we can walk throu what kind of magic is going there. I thing some of you just copy an paste that code. Understand code is important when you want to comform it to your program or different thing.
