How to connect to arduino and start up the thermomether DS18B20

First u need to check which pin of thermomether is chassis ground(usually black wire), which power(usually red wire) and which communicating pin(usually yellow wire).
Then you must connect communicating pin to digital pin number 2 on your arduino, chassis ground to GND, power to output 5V and link power and communicating pin with resistor.
Next u have to add libraries one wire and dallas temperature to your arduino IDE. You can find it here - http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/ds18b20-arduino
Now you must only find in example programmes dallas temperature, click it and upload to your arduino.
